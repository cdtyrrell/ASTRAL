Version 4.3.1:
  -- Output consensus bootstrap tree as well
  -- Output support only for internal branches
  -- Fix default seed number to 692
Version 4.3.0 (command-line options changed! Notice some commands are not backward compatible!):
  -- Performs bootstrapping (-b, -r, -g, -s added)
  -- Uses a library for argument parsing. We had to change some of the option names (exact version: -xt -> -x, extra trees: -ex -> -e).
  -- Does not output the number of quartets satisfied by each branch; that information was not interpretable. 
Version 4.2.1:
  -- Read input gene trees with internal node labels
  -- Updated the prompts and messages (e.g. Score instead of Cost)
  -- Software outputs the version number too
Version 4.2.0:
  -- (BUG FIX) overflow happened for large number of genes.  Use long instead of int
  -- Improve the command-line help a bit
Version 4.1.1:
  -- Added a hidden option to force algorithm 
Version 4.1:
  -- Updated the command-line so that ASTRAL algorithm is the default and DynaDup specific options are removed (-wq omitted and is default now)
Version 4.0:
  -- Added support for handling missing data by completing bipartitions
